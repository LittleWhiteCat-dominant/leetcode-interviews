# 312. Burst Balloons

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topics:** Array, Dynamic Programming
**Common companies:** Google, Amazon
**Category (README):** 12.2 2D DP

## Problem Description

You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the `ith` balloon, you will get `nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1]` coins. If `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `1` painted on it.

Return *the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely*.

 

**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [3,1,5,8]
**Output:** 167
**Explanation:**
nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167
```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [1,5]
**Output:** 10

```

 

**Constraints:**

	
- `n == nums.length`

	
- `1 <= n <= 300`

	
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Key Idea

Interval DP; think backward about the last balloon burst

## Approach

1. Identify the core pattern for this category: **12.2 2D DP**.
2. Use the key idea above as the primary strategy.
3. Confirm edge cases and state time/space complexity before coding.
4. Implement and verify against the examples above / on LeetCode.
