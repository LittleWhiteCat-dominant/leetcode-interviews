# 763. Partition Labels

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Category (README):** 13. Greedy

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string `"ababcc"` can be partitioned into `["abab", "cc"]`, but partitions such as `["aba", "bcc"]` or `["ab", "ab", "cc"]` are invalid.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be `s`.

Return *a list of integers representing the size of these parts*.

 

**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
**Output:** [9,7,8]
**Explanation:**
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** s = "eccbbbbdec"
**Output:** [10]

```

 

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= s.length <= 500`

	
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Key Idea

Record each character's last occurrence, greedily extend the interval

## Approach

1. Identify the core pattern for this category: **13. Greedy**.
2. Use the key idea above as the primary strategy.
3. Confirm edge cases and state time/space complexity before coding.
4. Implement and verify against the examples above / on LeetCode.
