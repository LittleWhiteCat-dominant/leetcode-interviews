**Category (README):** 12.2 2D DP

## Problem Description

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return *the length of their longest **common subsequence**. *If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

	
- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`

	
- `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Key Idea

dp[i][j] = LCS of the first i and first j characters

## Approach

1. Identify the core pattern for this category: **12.2 2D DP**.
2. Use the key idea above as the primary strategy.
3. Confirm edge cases and state time/space complexity before coding.
4. Implement and verify against the examples above / on LeetCode.

**Time Complexity:** O(m * n) — filling the DP table requires one constant-time transition per cell.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) — only the previous and current DP rows are kept instead of the full 2D table.

## Reference Solution (Python)

```python
def longestCommonSubsequence(text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    prev = [0] * (n + 1)

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        curr = [0] * (n + 1)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                curr[j] = prev[j - 1] + 1
            else:
                curr[j] = max(prev[j], curr[j - 1])
        prev = curr

    return prev[n]
```
